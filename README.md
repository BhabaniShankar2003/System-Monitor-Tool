🖥 Linux-Based System Monitor (C++) 📘 Objective

A simple Linux-based system monitor built in C++, which displays real-time CPU usage, memory usage, and running process count by reading data from the /proc file system. This project was developed as part of the Capstone Project (Linux System Programming).

⚙ Features

✅ Displays live CPU utilization percentage

✅ Shows current memory usage

✅ Counts and displays the total number of running processes

✅ Automatically refreshes every 3 seconds

Technologies Used

C++

Linux (WSL 2 on Windows)

/proc filesystem

How to Run

Open your Linux terminal (or WSL) and execute:

g++ main.cpp -o monitor ./monitor

   Output Example CPU Usage: 1.31% Memory Usage: 62.5%
   Conclusion

This project demonstrates how low-level system statistics can be accessed using the /proc filesystem in Linux, providing real-time system insights through simple C++ programming techniques.
