🖥 Linux-Based System Monitor (C++) 📘 Objective
A simple Linux-based system monitor built in C++, which displays real-time CPU usage, memory usage, and running process count by reading data from the /proc file system. This project was developed as part of the Capstone Project (Linux System Programming).
⚙ Features
 Displays live CPU utilization percentage
 Shows current memory usage
 Counts and displays the total number of running processes
 Automatically refreshes every 3 seconds
Technologies Used
  C++
Linux (WSL 2 on Windows)
/proc filesystem
How to Run
Open your Linux terminal (or WSL) and execute:
g++ main.cpp -o monitor ./monitor
📊 Output Example CPU Usage: 1.31% Memory Usage: 62.5%
🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how low-level system statistics can be accessed using the /proc filesystem in Linux, providing real-time system insights through simple C++ programming techniques.<img width="1919" height="1199" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-08 211552" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee57ae0-ead7-4c5b-8be4-4c7b7c6a07e6" />
